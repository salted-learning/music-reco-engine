## Music Reco Engine
Simple recommendation engine built on last.fm data
* To get data [Click Here](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html)
* To unzip file, you can use the zip_unzip_files.ipynb or do it yourself

Recommendation is a item-item collaborative filtering model (I think) that recommends similar artists.

### To-Do
* Create more user-friendly recommendation finder based on fuzzy matching of artist name
* Test alternative inputs - i.e binary listened, percent of user listens
* If artist meta-data exists, build a content recommendation engine -> then combine to make a hybrid recommendation
